# Predicting-the-cost-of-used-cars
I have used the data-set provided by machine hack, and ran a machine learning algorithm to predict used car prices.
I have performed exploratory analysis, processed the data, and also created visuals showing parameters affecting car prices.
I have also shown how close is my trained data to actual price values.

Finally I created a dataframe of predicted car prices.
