# Predicting-the-cost-of-used-cars
I have used the data-set provided by machine hack.

# Problem Statement

To predict cost of used cars given different features of car

# Solution provided

I have provided two solutions to this problem, one using ML algorithm (Linear Regression), and the other using TensorFlow.
I have performed exploratory analysis, processed the data, and also created visuals showing parameters affecting car prices.
I have also shown how close is my trained data to actual price values.
